I've always liked the idea of being independent. To be honest, who hasn't thought about it and imagined how "great" it could be - being your own boss, working when and how you want, doing what you love. It sounds pretty romantic, right? But how do you start? What do you do? How can you make money? Who would pay for what you do?

These are probably the first questions that come to mind when you think about starting your own business.

I was in the same situation. I wanted to do "something" - be independent and free. But what? In this short blog post, I want to write about how I started as a freelancer and the hurdles I had to overcome at the beginning. I hope that you can take some inspiration and motivation from it.

## **My path**

My path started shortly after my studies in electrical engineering. However, after starting my first job, I was absolutely dissatisfied. It wasn't fun, and I felt like I wasn't fully utilizing my potential. I was highly motivated after finishing my studies, but reality was different. Every day, I dragged myself to work and wondered how I would get through today's eight hours without getting bored.

I knew I had to make a change. Even then, I began searching for alternatives. I was looking for a way to use my talents and skills and make my passion my profession.

## **The Idea**

The idea of getting into freelancing came to me on vacation on the Greek island of Kos. While lying on the beach, I came across the topic of web development. I was excited about the idea that anyone could learn it and work from anywhere. That sounded great! So I ordered the book "JavaScript for Beginners."

Back home, I was highly motivated and started learning right away. I read the book in no time, but then I didn't know what to do next. I had no idea what I was actually doing.

I worked my way through every Udemy course on web development, going from tutorial to tutorial. ðŸ˜„ But somehow, I wasn't making progress. I could replicate many projects from the tutorials, but creating something myself felt impossible. I doubted my abilities. So I decided to focus on building my own projects.

My own projects were a lot of fun because I had created something myself. I invested a lot of time and let my friends try out my projects. But eventually, I lost motivation. The projects didn't serve a real purpose, and I doubted myself again.

However, I didn't give up and kept going. I realized that my projects didn't serve a real purpose, and I had to do something that someone could benefit from.

After a year of learning and practicing web development alongside my job, I still had no clients and had earned no money. But my goal was to become a freelancer. So I asked myself, "What should I do next?"

## **The next step**

Now was the time to start as a freelancer. I created my portfolio, which included both my own projects and projects from tutorials, and started applying for jobs on a freelancer platform. After just a few days, I received my first invitation to an interview.

I should mention that English is the common language on most freelancer platforms. Although English is not my native language, I was able to communicate at an acceptable level. This was an additional challenge for me, but one that I had to overcome. Over time, I was able to significantly improve my English through numerous meetings in English. Today, I'm pretty confident in the English language.

## **My first job**

Finally, I was able to earn my first money. I started my first project, which of course was underpaid, but I was incredibly happy to finally earn some money doing what I love. Looking back, I have to say that my work back then was really bad, but that's normal. Everyone starts somewhere, and the pay was appropriate for the quality.

Nevertheless, I was able to learn so much from it. When you create projects for yourself, you often stay in your comfort zone and don't learn much. Now I had a client who wanted something specific, and if I didn't know how it worked, I had to learn it and implement it for the client. I had put myself in a situation where I had to learn.

If I had known earlier how much I would learn through freelancing, I would have started much earlier. With freelancing, there are always new challenges where you can learn and improve your skills. It is incredibly motivating to see how by learning and improving your skills, you can also increase your hourly rate and thus receive even more recognition and financial reward for your work.

## **Dare to start**

Since I started freelancing, there is no turning back for me. The constant challenges and the opportunity to learn something new again and again make this work so fascinating for me. Currently, I still work as a freelancer alongside my full-time job, and I am now earning pretty well with it. I have firmly resolved to take the leap into full-time self-employment - and I know I will succeed!

Looking back, there are a few important lessons I have learned from this experience: It's never too late to start something new. You shouldn't be afraid and just follow your heart and do what brings you joy. And most importantly: You just have to start!

## **What to expect in the future**

In the future, I plan to write more about freelancing in general, offering tips, tricks, and sharing my experiences and insights. I believe that freelancing is a great opportunity for anyone looking for a flexible and independent work style, and I want to help others navigate this career path. Whether you're just starting out or looking to take your freelancing business to the next level, I hope to provide valuable information and support to help you succeed. I'm excited to continue my journey as a freelancer and share my knowledge with others in the freelancing community.
