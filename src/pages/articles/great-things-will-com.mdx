    "Building my portfolio was a journey that I've enjoyed. Still it's a ongoing adventure and I'm already excited about future projects and other things that will come. I want to write some articles very soon, so stay tuned!",

export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

Nothing here yet, I hope I'll find the time to write something soon. :)
